This is a part of the code, here is the code i worked hands on and the free objects and textures from the market.
The scene is arranged in blander and all the computation, rendering, animation, lights, shadows etc. are made here. 
From the blander I exported just the objects, their textures and coordonates. 

Here are some photos from the project:
